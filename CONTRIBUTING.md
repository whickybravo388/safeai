## 🛠️ Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Write clean, readable code
- Add docstrings in Google style
- Follow existing code style
- Add tests for new functionality

### 3. Run Tests and Linting

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=safeai --cov-report=html

# Run linting
ruff check .

# Run type checking
mypy safeai/
```

### 4. Commit Your Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new security rule for XSS detection"
```

Use conventional commit messages:
- `feat:` for new features
- `fix:` for bug fixes
- `docs:` for documentation
- `test:` for tests
- `refactor:` for code refactoring

### 5. Push and Create Pull Request

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then create a pull request on GitHub.

## 📋 Code Style Guidelines

### Python Code Style

- Follow PEP 8
- Use type hints
- Write descriptive variable names
- Keep functions small and focused
- Add docstrings for all public functions

### Example Code Style

```python
def detect_xss_vulnerability(code: str, ast_tree: Optional[ast.AST] = None) -> Optional[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """
    Detect potential XSS vulnerabilities in code.
    
    Args:
        code: Source code to analyze
        ast_tree: Parsed AST tree (optional)
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary with vulnerability details if found, None otherwise
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

### Test Style

- Write descriptive test names
- Use AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Test both positive and negative cases
- Mock external dependencies

```python
def test_detect_xss_in_script_tag():
    """Test detection of XSS in script tags."""
    # Arrange
    rule = XSSRule()
    code = "<script>alert('xss')</script>"
    
    # Act
    result = rule.check(code)
    
    # Assert
    assert result is not None
    assert result["id"] == "XSS001"
```

## 🔒 Adding New Security Rules

### 1. Create Rule Class

```python
# safeai/rules/python_rules.py

class XSSRule(BaseRule):
    """Rule XSS001: Detect potential XSS vulnerabilities."""
    
    id = "XSS001"
    description = "Potential XSS vulnerability detected"
    severity = "HIGH"
    recommendation = "Sanitize user input and use proper escaping"
    
    def check(self, code: str, ast_tree: Optional[ast.AST] = None) -> Optional[Dict[str, Any]]:
        """Check for XSS vulnerabilities."""
        # Your detection logic here
        if "dangerous_pattern" in code:
            return self._create_issue(
                line=1,
                column=0,
                code_snippet="dangerous_pattern",
                details="XSS vulnerability detected"
            )
        return None
```

### 2. Add to Rules List

```python
# safeai/rules/python_rules.py

def get_rules() -> List[BaseRule]:
    """Get all Python security rules."""
    return [
        # ... existing rules ...
        XSSRule(),
    ]
```

### 3. Write Tests

```python
# tests/test_rules.py

class TestXSSRule:
    """Test cases for XSSRule."""
    
    def test_xss_detection(self):
        """Test detection of XSS vulnerabilities."""
        rule = XSSRule()
        code = "<script>alert('xss')</script>"
        result = rule.check(code)
        
        assert result is not None
        assert result["id"] == "XSS001"
        assert result["severity"] == "HIGH"
    
    def test_no_xss(self):
        """Test code without XSS vulnerabilities."""
        rule = XSSRule()
        code = "print('hello world')"
        result = rule.check(code)
        
        assert result is None
```

### 4. Update Documentation

Add your rule to `docs/rules.md`:

```markdown
### XSS001: XSS Vulnerability

**Description**: Detects potential XSS vulnerabilities...

**Example Vulnerable Code**:
```python
# Vulnerable code
```

**Safe Alternative**:
```python
# Safe code
```
```

## 🧪 Testing Guidelines

### Test Coverage

- Aim for 80%+ test coverage
- Test all public methods
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Test both positive and negative scenarios

### Test Structure

```python
class TestYourFeature:
    """Test cases for YourFeature."""
    
    def test_basic_functionality(self):
        """Test basic functionality."""
        pass
    
    def test_edge_cases(self):
        """Test edge cases."""
        pass
    
    def test_error_conditions(self):
        """Test error conditions."""
        pass
```

### Fixtures

Use fixtures for common test data:

```python
# tests/fixtures/vulnerable_code.py
VULNERABLE_CODE = """
# Test code with vulnerabilities
result = eval('1 + 1')
"""

# tests/test_rules.py
def test_rule_with_fixture():
    """Test rule using fixture."""
    rule = SomeRule()
    result = rule.check(VULNERABLE_CODE)
    assert result is not None
```

## 📚 Documentation Guidelines

### Code Documentation

- Write clear docstrings for all public functions
- Include type hints
- Provide usage examples
- Document parameters and return values

### User Documentation

- Update README.md for new features
- Add examples to documentation
- Keep documentation up-to-date
- Use clear, concise language

### API Documentation

```python
def analyze_code(self, code: str, file_path: str = "") -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """
    Analyze code string for security vulnerabilities.
    
    Args:
        code: Source code to analyze
        file_path: Optional file path for context
        
    Returns:
        List of security issues found
        
    Example:
        >>> analyzer = CodeAnalyzer()
        >>> issues = analyzer.analyze_code("result = eval('1 + 1')")
        >>> print(f"Found {len(issues)} issues")
    """
```
